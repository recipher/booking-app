### RULES, TERMS & CONDITIONS AND EVENT INFORMATION

TweedLove On The Green – Bike Demos
8-10 June 2018
Tweed Valley, Scottish Borders


T&Cs: 

The TweedLove On The Green Bike Demo is ridden entirely at the participants own risk. The Organiser will not accept responsibility for personal injury or death, or damage to any equipment while riding the course. The participant agrees to indemnify the Organiser and Bike Brands from any liability for loss, damage or injury caused to whatever or whoever from use of the demo equipment. It is understood that by signing this waiver the risks attached to using the equipment are understood by the hirer/s and they agree that the Organiser makes every effort to provide fair warning in the terms of this agreement/waiver. 

Helmets are compulsory for all riders - riders must bring their own helmets. No rider will be allowed to take part in a demo ride without a helmet. Gloves are recommended. 

No riders age 12 years old or under are allowed to take part in the demo. Riders under 16 years of age must be accompanied by a riding parent or guardian who is responsible for the child's safety and understands the dangers of the event. 

Demonstration bicycles are the responsibility of the rider and loss, damage or misuse must be paid in full. A credit/debit card AND photographic ID (passport of driving license) will be required as deposit. 

The Organiser reserves the right to refuse entry to/participation in the demos if the terms and conditions are not met or if riders behave irresponsibly.


You must:
* Provide your height and weight prior to the demo (to allow the demo bike to be set up correctly for you). 
* Tell us whether you are bringing your own pedals prior to the demo (brands will most likely supply flat pedals, so if you’re riding clips you will most likely need to bring your own). 
* Bring your own helmet, and wear it at all times when participating in a demo. You will not be able to participate if you do not bring/wear a helmet. 
* Bring valid photo ID (passport, UK Citizen Card or driving licence) AND a credit/debit card. These items will be retained as a deposit by the organisers for the duration of the demo. 
* Only select ONE demo bike per time slot. You cannot demo more than one bike during any one time slot – if you select more than one bike per time slot, the organisers will select ONE of the bikes for you to demo, and you will be unable to demo the other (unless there is availability at a different time). 
* Provide details of an emergency contact – name and phone number. 
* Wear your demo wristband at all times during the demo day. 
* Inform us of any medical conditions (and of any changes to these in between registering online and the day of the demo). 
* Bring a printed copy of your confirmation email (which will also detail what bike you are demo-ing at what time) to registration. It is the participant’s responsibility to collect their demo bikes from the correct brands at the correct times, and missed time slots may not be possible to re-arrange. 

* The participant takes full responsibility for the care and use of the demo equipment for the demo period; from the location of the demo equipment until such time that the equipment is returned to the Event HQ in the same condition as the participant received the demo equipment.
* Riding of demo bikes is only permitted on the sections of course within the marked demo loop. Please note that there may be other riders using the trails. 
* The forest and trails will be open to other users, and sections will also be being used for the race. 
* The demos will be unmarshalled. We will provide a phone number for you to call if you need help on course during a demo. 
* There will not be mechanical support on course. If you have a mechanical which you cannot fix yourself, which will in turn cause you to be delayed and miss the cut-off time for your demo slot, there will be a number provided for you to call. 
* If a participant returns their demo bike more than 10 minutes after the end of their time slot, they will be charged £10 (this will be used to refund the next demo participant, who will subsequently miss their slot). 
* Under no circumstances will aggressive riding or behaviour towards other riders be tolerated. Any demo entrant found to be discourteous in any way to other riders will be removed from the demo and will be banned from future events. Foul or abusive language and poor behaviour will not be tolerated and will mean disqualification from this and possibly other future TweedLove events. Everyone’s here to have a good time.
* Signage will be in place along the entire course warning traffic of the event, but riders are always responsible for their own safety.
* The demo loop may include public roads with traffic present, where you must ride responsibly and considerately, and follow the Highway Code at all times. For riders from abroad, please remember to ride on the left.
* Please don’t drop any litter!
* The participant agrees to return the equipment to the agreed location on or before the time specified by the Organiser in the condition that it was hired without defect/s.
* The participant will notify the Organiser immediately if any damage is caused to the equipment, or if it is involved in an accident of any kind, during the demo period.
* The participant agrees that they will be responsible for any loss or damage caused to the equipment during the demo period, and will repay the cost of any such loss or damage.


Helmets are compulsory (you must bring your own). You must be self-sufficient. We recommend that all participants carry/wear:
* Gloves
* Mobile phone (charged!)
* Full body cover and waterproof jacket if conditions cold/wet
* Suitable backpack
* Innertubes/ puncture repair kit, spares
* Multi tool
* Basic, well maintained first aid kit

### EVENT INFO

#### Demo Process 

1. Each participant will register in person on the day(s) of their demo with the TweedLove team at the registration tent in the Event Village, Tweed Green, Peebles, EH45 8AP. We will retain the participant’s photo ID (passport or driving license) AND a corresponding debit/credit card as a deposit for the duration of the demo. We will then issue the participant with a wristband plus a  ‘Demo ID card’ - the wristband and Demo ID will have a corresponding number. 

2. Participants must register at least 30 minutes prior to their first demo slot - if you don’t register in time, your demo slot may be released. It will be the attendee’s responsibility to collect their demo bikes from the correct brands at the correct times. 

3. Participants will collect their bikes from the brands directly. They will exchange their Demo ID card for the bike. It will be returned when the bike is handed back in good condition. 

4. Demonstration bicycles are the responsibility of the participant who is demo-ing/riding the bike, and loss, damage or misuse must be paid in full. In the case of any damage/loss, the brand will be responsible for acquiring payment from the participant. 

5. Attendees must return their bikes to the brands at, or before, the end of their demo time slot, and will exchange the bike for their Demo ID card. 

6. After attendees have finished demo-ing, they will return to TweedLove with their Demo ID card and corresponding wristband, and exchange these for their original forms of ID (photo ID and credit/debit card). 


Helmets are compulsory for all riders - riders must bring their own helmets. No rider will be allowed to take part in a demo ride without a helmet. Gloves are recommended. 

Participants must register with TweedLove at least 30 minutes prior to their first demo slot of the day, or risk their slot being released. 

Participants must arrive to collect their bike from the brand within 15 minutes of their time slot starting (i.e. if their time slot is 10am-11:30am, they must have arrived by 10:15am to collect their bike). 

Participants must return their bike to the brand at, or before, the end of their time slot. This allows the brands 30 minutes to set up the bike(s) for the next demo time slot. 

If a participant returns their demo bike more than 10 minutes after the end of their time slot, they will be charged £10. 

Demonstration bicycles are the responsibility of the rider and loss, damage or misuse must be paid in full. A credit/debit card AND corresponding photographic ID (passport of driving license) will be required as deposit.
